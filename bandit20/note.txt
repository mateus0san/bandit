There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes
a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It
then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in
the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the
password for the next level (bandit21).

build a basic client/server model and execute the setuid binary passing the port
in its argument. send the password of the current level in the listening process
